# DevOps course - Task1

My first project, created during **DevOps** course on rebrainme.com

## Getting Started

These project is using for developing DevOps skills and getting new knowladge about **GIT**.

### Prerequisites

For correct work we need to install git software:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Installing

To get default nginx config we need to install nginx server:


```
sudo apt-get install ngxinx
```

Then we need to copy nginx.conf to our project directory:

```
cp /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ~/our_project
```

Now we are ready to complete task1!

## Running the tests

Ensure that we have config file in our dierctory:

### Break down into end to end tests
Executing this command will give us list of files in our project directory:

```
ls -la ~/our_project
```
Make sure we had nginx.conf

## Built With
